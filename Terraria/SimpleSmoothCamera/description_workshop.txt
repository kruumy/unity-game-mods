[h1]Simple Smooth Camera[/h1]
Smooth out the default camera movement. A complete rework of the camera update method and also highly configurable.
Note: This is only a basic implementation right now. Other things that mess with the camera's postion in-game, besides the player movement, is not implmented yet. This includes the binoculars and any other camera altering equipment.

This mod is inspired by the smooth camera from Terraria Overhaul By Mirsario.
This mod also supports High FPS Support by Stellar.
